          "description": "While working on enemy AI in Spray N Pray, I hit a limitation with Unreal's EQS: it only generates points on the NavMesh â€” great for ground AI, but not for flying characters. So I created a custom 3D EQS generator to solve the problem.\n\nðŸ”§ What I built:\n\nA cube-shaped EQS generator that spawns points in 3D space around the flying enemy\n\nPoints are scored by distance to the player (closer = better)\n\nPoints are filtered out if:\n\nThey don't have a clear line of sight\n\nThey're too close to or overlapping with obstacles\n\nThe flying enemy moves to the best-scoring point\n\nThis process loops until it's close enough to the player\n\nThe core logic was implemented in C++, and the behavior is managed using Blueprint Behavior Trees â€” a flexible and powerful combo.",
